# Date Counter

A React app that calculates dates relative to today. Adjust the step size and count to see what date it will be in the future or what date it was in the past.

## Features

- **Step Control**: Use the step buttons to increment or decrement the step value (minimum step is 1)
- **Count Control**: Use the count buttons to add or subtract the step value from the count
- **Date Calculation**: The app displays:
  - Today's date when count is 0
  - The date N days from today when count is positive
  - The date N days ago when count is negative
